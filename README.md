This is my README.md file for the Odin Project Etch-A-Sketch project.

The idea is I'll set up a little webpage where you can draw very pixelated 
images. In several colours.

The skills I will have demonstrated once I have completed this project 
include... beginner CSS, beginner javascript, beginner HTML, and some 
facility with Git.
