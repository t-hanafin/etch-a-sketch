This is my README.md file for the Odin Project Etch-A-Sketch project.

The idea is I'll set up a little webpage where you can draw very pixelated 
images. In several colours.

The skills I will have demonstrated once I have completed this project 
include... beginner CSS, beginner javascript, beginner HTML, and some 
facility with Git.

Adding on February 15 2023: 

I've set up the basic elements of an etch-a-sketch game website. 

Javascript generates the matrix. I learned how to use CSS flexboxes to create a matrix
that can fit perfectly into any container size. I learned how to insert CSS properties
into a page (or page's DOM) using javascript. I learned how to manipulate RGB values using
JS. I maintained a regular Git commit schedule, with reasonably descriptive comments. I 
figured out how to add an eventlistener to a page--and not only to a page, but to a particular
HTML element of a page.

Finally, my code is written so that (I hope) it does not need extensive commenting to explain
how it works. The variable and function names are clear and descriptive.
